Focus on these relationship types:
- 'imports': Module/package imports and dependencies
- 'implements': Interface implementation, trait implementation
- 'extends': Class inheritance, module extension
- 'calls': Function/method calls between modules
- 'uses': Utility usage, service consumption
- 'configures': Configuration setup, dependency injection
- 'factory_creates': Factory pattern instantiation
- 'observer_pattern': Event listening, callback registration
- 'strategy_pattern': Algorithm selection, behavior delegation
- 'adapter_pattern': Interface adaptation, wrapper usage
- 'architectural_dependency': High-level system dependencies

Respond with a JSON array of relationships. Each relationship must include:
- source_path: relative path of source file
- target_path: relative path of target file
- relation_type: one of the types listed above
- description: specific explanation of HOW the relationship works
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 confidence score (use 0.8+ for clear relationships)

Only include relationships with clear architectural significance. Avoid trivial imports."""

- Key patterns or architectural decisions it implements

Avoid listing specific functions/classes. Instead, describe the file's architectural significance and how it fits into the larger system design."""
